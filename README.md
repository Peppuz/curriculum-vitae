## Experiences

**OrariSTP**
> I've done multiple experiences, starting from the summer of 2014, in my beloved Apulia, when me and my cousin stopped at the wrong bus stop in a city we didn't even know, all this because we felt asleep. I woke up and I immiediately looked for infos to try to get back to my hometown. It was so damn hard, phones were dead, and people gave wrong informations. So there come a little idea: I wanted all informations about bus stops, timelines, and ticket vendors, in my fucking hand.
Finally when we got back to SanVito, without tickets cause all vendors were closed, I explained my need to a group of close friends, and they felt in love with the idea. 
We lunched in the winter of that year, with only 5 cities available and few users.
Now we count 20k+ downloads for each Store, and 1500 DAUs (1-1-20).

OrariSTP is a Progressive Web Application to get timelines, bus stops, and ticket vendors of public transit in the province of Brindisi.

Built in PHP and MySQL, initially we copied by hand all the timelines, after some months we switched to GTFS standard.
